# emitters

**nodejs.available** - This state is automatically emitted once Node.js has been
installed. Rely on this state to perform an application deployment when Node.js
is ready to be used.

# api

All helper modules are found in `lib/nodejs.py`

Example,

```python

from nodejs import npm, node_dist_dir

print(node_dist_dir())
# /srv/app

@when('nodejs.available')
def install_deps():
    npm('install')
    npm('test')

```
